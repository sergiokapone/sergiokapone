# Hello!

I am a physicist with a doctoral degree in physics of polymers. I have teaching experience and a passion for programming. 

My research and teaching background has allowed me to utilize programming, especially Python, for automating routine tasks, analyzing and processing complex data, visualizing physical phenomena, and modeling physical processes. 
My goal has been to help students deepen their understanding of physics concepts and enhance the quality of their research work through the use of programming.

I always strive to improve my skills and explore new technologies. 
I enjoy working in the areas of data analysis, modeling of physical systems and processes, and software development for scientific and engineering tasks.
